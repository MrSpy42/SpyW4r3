This is a peer2peer messaging software that can be used to send simple messages between clients. It has AES encryption, which i implented very insecurely but it was done for learning purposes so all good. You have to start the listeners on both instances of the program and the ports have to be 4digit. 

### TO DO
-Fix connections locally.

-Make it able to take any kind of port.

-Set a port and start the listener automatically.

-Make encryption more secure. 

-Add color or sth like that.

-Generally make it look better.
